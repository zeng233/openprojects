/**
 * Support class for throttling concurrent access to a specific resource.
 *
 * <p>Designed for use as a base class, with the subclass invoking the
 * <code>beforeAccess</code> and <code>afterAccess</code> methods at
 * appropriate points of its workflow. Note that <code>afterAccess</code>
 * should usually be called in a finally block!.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed for serializability, to allow for serializing
 * interceptors that derive from it. Note that the subclass needs to explicitly
 * implement the Serializable marker interface if it is actually serializable.
