/**
 * Abstract BeanPostProcessor implementation that creates AOP proxies. 
 * This class is completely generic; it contains no special code to handle
 * any particular aspects, such as pooling aspects.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses must implement the abstract <code>findCandidateAdvisors()</code>
 * method to return a list of Advisors applying to any object. Subclasses can
 * also override the inherited <code>shouldSkip</code> method to exclude certain
 * objects from auto-proxying, but they must be careful to invoke the base
 * <code>shouldSkip</code> method, which tries to avoid circular reference
 * problems and infinite loops.
 *
 * <p>Advisors or advices requiring ordering should implement the Ordered interface.
 * This class sorts advisors by Ordered order value. Advisors that don't implement
 * the Ordered interface will be considered to be unordered, and will appear
 * at the end of the advisor chain in undefined order.
