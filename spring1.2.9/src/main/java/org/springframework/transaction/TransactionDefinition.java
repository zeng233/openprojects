/**
 * Interface for classes that define transaction properties.
 * Base interface for TransactionAttribute.
 *
 * <p>Note that isolation level, timeout and read-only settings will not get
 * applied unless a new transaction gets started. As only PROPAGATION_REQUIRED
 * and PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW can actually cause that, it usually doesn't make
 * sense to specify those settings in all other cases. Furthermore, be aware
 * that not all transaction managers will support those advanced features and
 * thus might throw corresponding exceptions when given non-default values.
