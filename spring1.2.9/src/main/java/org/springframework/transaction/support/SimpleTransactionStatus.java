 * Simple, generic implementation of the TransactionStatus interface.
 * Derives from AbstractTransactionStatus and adds an explicit "newTransaction" flag.
 *
 * <p>This class is not used by any of Spring's pre-built PlatformTransactionManager
 * implementations. It is mainly provided as a start for custom transaction manager
 * implementations and as a static mock for testing transactional code (either
 * as part of a mock PlatformTransactionManager or as argument passed into a
 * TransactionCallback to be tested).
