/**
 * <p>Interface defining a factory which can return an Object instance
 * (possibly shared or independent) when invoked.
 * 
 * <p>This interface is typically used to encapsulate a generic factory  which
 * returns a new instance (prototype) of some target object on each invocation.
 *
 * <p>This interface is similar to FactoryBean, but implementations of the latter
 * are normally meant to be defined as instances by the user in a BeanFactory,
 * while implementations of this class are normally meant to be fed as a property
 * to other beans. As such, the <code>getObject</code> method has different
 * exception handling behavior.
