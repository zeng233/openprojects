/**
 * Interface for strategies that register custom property editors with a
 * data binder. This is particularly useful when you need to use the
 * same set of property editors in several different situations: write
 * a corresponding registrar and reuse that in each case.
 *
 * <p>Note: This interface is only intended for use with Spring Web Flow previews.
 * Since Spring 1.2.6, it is superseded by the PropertyEditorRegistrar interface
 * in the beans package, working on a passed-in PropertyEditorRegistry interface
 * rather than the DataBinder class. This is also what Spring Web Flow 1.0 RC1+
 * is using.
 * 
 * @author Keith Donald
 * @since 1.2.2
 * @deprecated since Spring 1.2.6, in favor of the PropertyEditorRegistrar
 * interface in the <code>org.springframework.beans</code> package
 * @see org.springframework.beans.PropertyEditorRegistrar
 * @see org.springframework.beans.PropertyEditorRegistry
