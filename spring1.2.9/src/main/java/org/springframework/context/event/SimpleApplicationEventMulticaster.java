/**
 * Simple implementation of the ApplicationEventMulticaster interface.
 *
 * <p>Multicasts all events to all registered listeners, leaving it up to
 * the listeners to ignore events that they are not interested in.
 * Listeners will usually perform corresponding <code>instanceof</code>
 * checks on the passed-in event object.
 *
 * <p>All listeners are invoked in the calling thread. This allows the danger of
 * a rogue listener blocking the entire application, but adds minimal overhead.
 *
 * <p>An alternative implementation could be more sophisticated in both these respects.
