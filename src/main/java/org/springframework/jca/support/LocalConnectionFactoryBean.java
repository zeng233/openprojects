/**
 * This FactoryBean creates a local JCA connection factory in "non-managed" mode
 * (as defined by the Java Connector Architecture specification).
 *
 * <p>The type of the connection factory is dependent on the actual connector:
 * the connector can either expose its native API or follow the standard
 * Common Client Interface (CCI), as defined by the JCA spec. In the latter case,
 * the exposed interface is <code>javax.resource.cci.ConnectionFactory</code>.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> In non-managed mode, a connector is not deployed on an
 * application server. Consequently, it can't use the server's system contracts:
 * connection management, transaction management, and security management.
 *
 * <p>In particular, the connector uses a local ConnectionManager (either the
 * connector's default or a locally specified one) and can't participate in global
 * transactions, because the connector will never be enlisted/delisted in the
 * current JTA transaction. You can either use the native local transaction
 * facilities of the exposed API (e.g. CCI local transactions), or use a
 * corresponding implementation of Spring's PlatformTransactionManager SPI
 * (e.g. CciLocalTransactionManager) to drive local transactions.
 *
 * <p>In order to use this FactoryBean, you must specify the connector's
 * "managedConnectionFactory" (usually configured as separate JavaBean),
 * which will be used to create the actual connection factory. Optionally,
 * you can also specify a "connectionManager", to use an explicit,
 * JCA-compliant ConnectionManager instead of the connector's default.
